TEMPLATE SENDING SUCCESSFULLY TESTED FOR GROWTHPOINT
WHAT I DID:
I sent a test of the growthpoint_lift_emergency template through the Woosh Bridge and it worked perfectly. The template was delivered successfully to my phone number.
ENDPOINT USED:
POST https://wa.woosh.ai/v1/send
HEADERS REQUIRED:
Content-Type: application/json
x-tenant-key: c991fd90-d50d-4b44-9228-b4dd78e47162
REQUEST BODY THAT WORKED:
{
"to": "27824537125",
"type": "template",
"template": {
"name": "growthpoint_lift_emergency",
"language": {"code": "en"}
}
}
THE CRITICAL DETAIL:
The language code MUST be "en" (just the two letters), NOT "en_US" or "en_ZA".
The template is registered in Meta's system with language code "en" and WhatsApp requires an EXACT match. If they send "en_US" or omit the language entirely (which causes the bridge to default to "en_US"), they will get error 132001 saying the template doesn't exist.
HOW GROWTHPOINT SHOULD USE IT:
Send a POST request to: https://wa.woosh.ai/v1/send
Include these headers:
Content-Type: application/json
x-tenant-key: c991fd90-d50d-4b44-9228-b4dd78e47162
Include this JSON body (replace the "to" number with their recipient):
to: the recipient's phone number in format "27821234567"
type: "template"
template: object containing:
name: "growthpoint_lift_emergency"
language: object containing:
code: "en" (this MUST be exactly "en", not "en_US")
BOTH APPROVED TEMPLATES AVAILABLE:
growthpoint_lift_emergency - Language: "en" - Status: APPROVED
growthpoint_entrapment_confirmed - Language: "en" - Status: APPROVED
Both use language code "en" and both are ready to send.
THE BRIDGE DOES NOT REQUIRE PRE-REGISTRATION:
Templates do not need to be configured or stored in Woosh Bridge. GrowthPoint can send ANY approved template from their WABA - the bridge passes it straight through to Meta's API without any validation or filtering on our side.
ERROR THEY'RE GETTING:
Error 132001 "template name does not exist in en" means Meta cannot find the template with that exact name and language combination. This happens when:
The language code doesn't match exactly (they send "en_US" but template is "en")
The template name has a typo
They're missing the language object entirely (causing default to "en_US")
CONFIRMED WORKING:
I just tested and successfully sent the growthpoint_lift_emergency template through the bridge using language code "en" and it delivered perfectly. The bridge is working correctly - they just need to ensure they're sending language code "en" exactly.
