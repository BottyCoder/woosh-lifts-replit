## Security Architecture Overview

### Multi-Layer Security Model

The system implements defence-in-depth security across multiple layers:

1. **Transport Layer Security**: All external communications use TLS 1.2+ encryption
2. **Authentication Layer**: Token-based authentication for administrative and webhook endpoints
3. **Authorization Layer**: Single-token authentication for administrative functions (no role-based access control)
4. **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL with encrypted connections and parameterized queries
5. **Application Layer**: Input validation, rate limiting, and error handling

### Zero-Trust Principles

- No implicit trust between system components
- All endpoints require explicit authentication
- Minimal privilege principle applied throughout
- Continuous verification of requests

---

## Authentication Mechanisms

### 1. Administrative Authentication

**Method**: Bearer Token Authentication

**Implementation**:
- Token-based authentication using cryptographically secure random tokens
- Tokens stored as environment variables, never in code or version control
- Multiple authentication header support:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
  - `X-Admin-Token: <token>`

**Token Requirements**:
- Minimum 32 characters
- High entropy (recommended: 256-bit random value)
- Rotatable without system downtime
- Single token model (simplified credential management)

**Protected Endpoints**:
- `/admin/*` - All administrative operations
- Lift management (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Contact management (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Message history access
- System configuration

**Security Considerations**:
- Token transmitted over HTTPS only
- Partial token logging on startup (first 8 characters) - should be removed for production hardening
- Failed authentication attempts logged for monitoring
- No timing attack vulnerabilities in token comparison

### 2. SMS Webhook Authentication

**Method**: HMAC-SHA256 Signature Verification

**Implementation**:
- Inbound SMS webhooks from SMS Portal verified using HMAC signatures
- Shared secret stored as environment variable (`SMSPORTAL_HMAC_SECRET`)
- Request body signed with shared secret
- Signature included in webhook headers

**Verification Process**:
```
1. Extract signature from webhook header
2. Compute HMAC-SHA256 of raw request body using shared secret
3. Compare computed signature with provided signature
4. Reject request if signatures don't match
```

**Security Benefits**:
- Prevents webhook spoofing
- Ensures message integrity (tampering detection)
- Validates sender authenticity
- No replay attack vulnerability (when combined with timestamp validation)

**Fallback Behaviour**:
- If HMAC secret not configured, webhook processing continues (development mode)
- Production deployments must configure HMAC secrets

### 3. WhatsApp Webhook Authentication

**Method**: Bearer Token Authentication

**Implementation**:
- Inbound WhatsApp webhooks from Woosh Ai authenticated via bearer token
- Dedicated webhook authentication token (`WEBHOOK_AUTH_TOKEN`)
- Separate from administrative token (principle of least privilege)

**Protected Endpoint**:
- `/webhooks/whatsapp` - WhatsApp interactive button responses

**Security Considerations**:
- Token validation occurs before any business logic processing
- Unauthorized requests logged with source IP
- Failed authentication returns generic 401 response (no information leakage)
- Token rotatable independently of admin credentials

### 4. WhatsApp Business API Authentication

**Method**: API Key Authentication

**Implementation**:
- Outbound WhatsApp messages authenticated via API key header
- API key provided by Woosh Ai, stored as environment variable (`BRIDGE_API_KEY`)
- Header varies by endpoint:
  - Template and text messages (`/v1/send`): `x-tenant-key: <key>`
  - Interactive messages (`/api/messages/send`): `X-Api-Key: <key>`

**Security Benefits**:
- Prevents unauthorized use of WhatsApp Business API
- Rate limiting enforced by provider
- API key rotatable through provider portal

**Note**: Header inconsistency exists for historical reasons; both headers authenticate with the same API key value

---

## Data Protection

### Database Security

**Connection Security**:
- PostgreSQL connections over TLS/SSL
- Connection string stored as environment variable (`DATABASE_URL`)
- SSL mode enforcement for production environments
- Connection pooling with secure credential management

**Query Security**:
- 100% parameterized queries (no string concatenation)
- Protection against SQL injection attacks
- Database user principle of least privilege
- No direct SQL execution from user input

**Data Storage**:
- Sensitive data (phone numbers) stored without formatting characters
- Contact information includes: names, phone numbers, roles
- Message content logged for audit purposes
- Ticket lifecycle tracked with timestamps

**Database Access Control**:
- Administrative interface requires authentication
- No public database endpoints
- Read-only vs. read-write separation where applicable

### Secrets Management

**Environment Variables**:
All sensitive credentials stored as environment variables:
- `ADMIN_TOKEN` - Administrative authentication
- `BRIDGE_API_KEY` - WhatsApp API authentication
- `BRIDGE_TEMPLATE_NAME` - WhatsApp template identifier
- `BRIDGE_TEMPLATE_LANG` - Template language code
- `SMSPORTAL_HMAC_SECRET` - SMS webhook verification
- `WEBHOOK_AUTH_TOKEN` - WhatsApp webhook authentication
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string

**Secret Protection**:
- Never logged or printed in application output
- Not committed to version control
- Rotatable without code changes
- Separate secrets for different authentication contexts

**Secret Rotation**:
- All secrets can be rotated independently
- No shared secrets between authentication contexts
- Rolling rotation supported (update environment, restart service)

### Data in Transit

**External Communications**:
- All HTTP communications over TLS 1.2+
- Certificate validation enforced
- No fallback to unencrypted connections

**API Integrations**:
- SMS Portal: HTTPS with HMAC verification
- Woosh Ai WhatsApp Business: HTTPS with API key authentication
- No plaintext credential transmission

### Data at Rest

**Database Encryption**:
- Database provider responsible for encryption at rest
- Compatible with Neon, Supabase, Railway (all support encryption at rest)
- Backup encryption handled by provider

**Application Storage**:
- No sensitive data cached in application memory beyond request lifecycle
- Temporary debugging buffers (development only) cleared on restart

---

## Input Validation and Sanitization

### Phone Number Validation

**Normalization**:
- All phone numbers normalized to E.164 format without `+` symbol
- Example: `+27 82 123 4567` â†’ `27821234567`
- Prevents duplicate entries due to formatting differences

**Validation Rules**:
- Must match South African phone number format
- Length validation (10-15 digits)
- Numeric characters only after normalization

### Message Content Validation

**SMS Processing**:
- Maximum message length enforced
- Character encoding validation (UTF-8)
- No code execution from message content

**WhatsApp Processing**:
- Template-based messaging only (prevents injection attacks)
- User input limited to button clicks (predefined options)
- No arbitrary message content from external sources

### API Input Validation

**Request Validation**:
- Content-Type verification
- Request size limits enforced
- JSON schema validation for structured data
- Parameter type checking
- Required field validation

**Sanitization**:
- HTML/JavaScript escaping for any user-provided content
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- Path traversal prevention in file operations

---

## Error Handling and Information Disclosure

### Secure Error Responses

**Production Error Handling**:
- Generic error messages to external clients
- No stack traces exposed to end users
- No database error details in responses
- No internal path information disclosed

**Development vs. Production**:
- Detailed errors logged server-side only
- Environment-based error verbosity
- Stack traces logged but never returned in HTTP responses

**HTTP Status Codes**:
- `401 Unauthorized` - Authentication failures
- `403 Forbidden` - Authorization failures
- `404 Not Found` - Resource not found
- `409 Conflict` - Constraint violations (e.g., duplicate entries)
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Generic server errors

### Logging and Monitoring

**Security Event Logging**:
- Authentication failures logged with timestamp and source
- Webhook authentication failures logged
- Database constraint violations logged
- Administrative actions logged with user context

**Log Security**:
- No sensitive credentials logged
- Phone numbers logged for audit purposes (POPIA compliance considerations apply)
- Request/response logging with configurable verbosity
- Logs retained for audit trail purposes

**Monitoring Capabilities**:
- Request logging via middleware
- Error rate monitoring
- Database query performance logging
- External API call success/failure tracking

---

## API Security

### Rate Limiting

**Considerations**:
- SMS webhooks: Rate limited by SMS Portal infrastructure
- WhatsApp webhooks: Rate limited by Woosh Ai infrastructure
- Administrative endpoints: Application-level rate limiting recommended for production

### Request Timeout Protection

**Timeout Configuration**:
- Outbound API calls: 30-second timeout
- Prevents resource exhaustion from hung connections
- Graceful failure handling on timeout

### CORS Configuration

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**:
- Administrative interface served from same origin
- No CORS required for API endpoints (server-to-server only)
- If CORS needed, restricted to specific origins only

---

## Threat Model and Mitigations

### Threat: Unauthorized Administrative Access

**Attack Vector**: Attacker attempts to access administrative endpoints

**Mitigations**:
- Strong token-based authentication
- HTTPS-only communication
- Token rotation capability
- Failed access logging

**Risk Level**: Low (with proper token management)

### Threat: Webhook Spoofing

- HMAC signature verification for SMS webhooks
- Bearer token authentication for WhatsApp webhooks
- Request validation and sanitization
- Source IP logging

**Risk Level**: Low (with HMAC and token authentication)

### Threat: SQL Injection

**Attack Vector**: Attacker injects SQL through user input

**Mitigations**:
- 100% parameterized queries
- No dynamic SQL construction
- Input validation and type checking
- Database user least privilege

**Risk Level**: Very Low (parameterized queries prevent injection)

### Threat: Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

**Attack Vector**: Attacker intercepts network traffic

**Mitigations**:
- TLS 1.2+ encryption for all communications
- Certificate validation enforced
- No fallback to unencrypted protocols
- HTTPS-only cookie flags (if cookies used)

**Risk Level**: Very Low (TLS mandatory)

### Threat: Credential Exposure

**Attack Vector**: API keys or tokens exposed in logs, code, or version control

**Mitigations**:
- Environment variable storage
- No credentials in code or version control
- Secure logging (no credential logging)
- Secret rotation capability

**Risk Level**: Low (with proper secrets management)

### Threat: Denial of Service

**Attack Vector**: Attacker floods endpoints with requests

**Mitigations**:
- External rate limiting at infrastructure level
- Request timeout enforcement
- Connection pooling limits
- Provider-level DDoS protection (SMS Portal, Woosh Ai)

**Risk Level**: Medium (dependent on infrastructure)

### Threat: Ticket Confusion in Multi-Emergency Scenarios

**Attack Vector**: Attacker or system bug causes button responses to affect wrong ticket

**Mitigations**:
- Unique message ID tracking per ticket
- Context.id matching for precise ticket identification
- Transaction-based ticket updates
- Audit trail of all ticket actions

**Risk Level**: Very Low (robust message tracking architecture)

### Threat: Replay Attacks

**Attack Vector**: Attacker captures and resends valid webhook requests

**Mitigations**:
- HMAC signatures prevent request modification
- Timestamp validation recommended (not currently implemented)
- Idempotency considerations in business logic

**Risk Level**: Medium (timestamp validation would reduce to Low)

- System metadata: IP addresses in logs, authentication timestamps

**Purpose Limitation**:
All personal information collected serves the specific, explicitly defined purpose of:
- Emergency lift incident notification and response
- Building management communication
- Audit trail for compliance and safety
- System troubleshooting and performance monitoring

**Lawful Processing Basis**:
- **Legitimate Interest** (primary): Emergency response and building safety management

- **Legal Obligation**: Potential building safety regulations requiring emergency communication systems

#### Data Subject Rights (POPIA Section 23-25)

**1. Right of Access**:
- Data subjects can request access to their personal information via administrator
- Administrative interface provides complete message history per contact
- Response timeframe: Within POPIA-mandated period (reasonable time, not exceeding 30 days)

**2. Right to Correction**:
- Contact details (name, phone number) updatable via admin interface
- Incorrect lift associations can be modified
- Historical message records are immutable for audit integrity

**3. Right to Deletion/Erasure**:
- Contact records deletable via admin interface
- Cascading delete: Removes lift_contacts associations automatically
- Message history linked to deleted contacts retained for audit purposes with contact reference removed
- Retention considerations: Emergency response audit requirements vs. erasure rights

**4. Right to Object**:
- Data subjects can object to processing via administrator

#### Data Retention and Destruction

**Retention Policy**:
- **Contact Information**: Retained while contact is active in system
- **Message History**: Indefinite retention for audit purposes (should be defined per business requirements)
- **Event Logs**: Indefinite retention for security monitoring (should be defined per business requirements)
- **Recommendation**: Define retention periods aligned with:
  - Building safety regulation requirements
  - Insurance/liability considerations
  - POPIA principle of limited retention

**Destruction Method**:
- Database record deletion (PostgreSQL DELETE operations)
- Cascading deletes for referential integrity
- Database provider responsible for storage-level destruction
- Backup retention follows database provider policy

**Retention Schedule Recommendation**:
- Active contacts: Retained while service agreement active
- Closed tickets: 5-7 years (aligned with typical safety record retention)
- System logs: 2 years minimum for security incident investigation
- Automated deletion: Should be implemented based on defined retention policy

#### Cross-Border Data Transfer

**Current Configuration**:
- Database hosting location configurable (Neon, Supabase, Railway)
- South African data center options available via all providers
- No mandatory cross-border data transfer

**Transborder Information Flow Compliance (POPIA Section 72)**:
- If database hosted outside South Africa:
  - Ensure provider has adequate data protection (adequacy assessment)
  - Contractual safeguards with database provider required
  - Data subject notification of cross-border transfer recommended
- Recommendation: Use South African database regions for POPIA compliance simplicity

**Third-Party Processors**:
- **SMS Portal**: South African provider, data remains in SA
- **Woosh Ai**: WhatsApp Business API provider - confirm data residency
- **Database Provider**: Configurable region - select South African data center
- **Meta/WhatsApp**: End-to-end encrypted messages, Meta operates globally

#### Responsible Party vs. Operator Classification

**System Owner/Deployer** (Responsible Party under POPIA):
- Determines purpose and means of processing
- Responsible for POPIA compliance obligations
- Must register as Responsible Party with Information Regulator
- Liable for data protection compliance

**System Operator** (if applicable):
- If system managed by third-party on behalf of owner
- Processes data per Responsible Party instructions only
- Must have written agreement defining responsibilities
- Subject to Operator obligations under POPIA Section 21

**Third-Party Processors**:
- SMS Portal, Woosh Ai, Database Provider act as Operators
- Processing agreements must be in place
- Operators must maintain adequate security safeguards
- Responsible Party retains primary POPIA compliance accountability

#### Incident Response and Data Breach Notification

**Breach Definition**:
Any compromise of the security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal information.

**Incident Detection**:
- Failed authentication attempt logging
- Unusual access pattern monitoring

2. **Assessment (24-72 hours)**:
   - Determine personal information affected
   - Identify number of data subjects impacted
   - Assess harm potential (identity theft, financial loss, reputational damage, etc.)
   - Evaluate if breach meets notification threshold

3. **Notification Obligations (POPIA Section 22)**:
   - **Information Regulator**: Notify "as soon as reasonably possible" if breach likely to cause harm
   - **Data Subjects**: Notify affected individuals if breach likely to cause harm
   - **Notification Content**: Describe breach, categories of data, likely consequences, measures taken, contact information

4. **Remediation and Lessons Learned**:
   - Implement corrective measures
   - Update security procedures
   - Document incident and response
   - Review and improve security controls

**Notification Thresholds**:
- Unauthorized access to contact database: **Notify**
- Exposure of message history: **Notify**
