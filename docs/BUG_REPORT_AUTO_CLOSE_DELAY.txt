BUG REPORT: AUTO-CLOSE DELAYED BY 94 MINUTES

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

Ticket 22 (JAMES-HOUSE-TKT22) experienced a 94-minute delay between when it should have auto-closed and when it actually did. This happened because the database query bug was preventing the auto-close from executing, and it only succeeded after you deployed the fix.


================================================================================
TIMELINE - WHAT HAPPENED
================================================================================

12:45:05 - Ticket 22 created (emergency SMS received from James House lift)
12:46:10 - Reminder 1/3 sent (1 minute after creation)
12:48:14 - Reminder 2/3 sent (2 minutes after reminder 1)
12:50:12 - Reminder 3/3 sent (2 minutes after reminder 2)

EXPECTED: Auto-close should trigger around 12:51:12 (1 minute after 3rd reminder)

ACTUAL: Nothing happened for 94 minutes

12:51:12 to 14:23:19 - System tried to auto-close every 60 seconds
                     - Database query failed each time due to parameter bug
                     - Ticket stuck in limbo with reminder_count = 3

14:24:00 (approx) - You deployed the bug fix (correct parameter reference)
                   - Server restarted with fixed code

14:24:19 - Auto-close FINALLY succeeded
         - Escalation message sent to all contacts
         - 94 minutes late


================================================================================
WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED
================================================================================

After the 3rd reminder is sent:

1. System marks ticket with reminder_count = 3
2. Background job runs (every 60 seconds)
3. Finds tickets with reminder_count > 3 and status = open
4. Executes UPDATE query to close ticket
5. Sends escalation message to all contacts

Expected total time: 12:50:12 + 1 minute = 12:51:12


================================================================================
WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED
================================================================================

Steps 1-3 worked fine.

Step 4 FAILED for 94 minutes because the SQL UPDATE query had incorrect parameter reference:

The query referenced WHERE id = dollar-sign-2
But only passed bracket-ticket-dot-id-bracket which is parameter position dollar-sign-1

PostgreSQL error: "could not determine data type of parameter dollar-sign-1"

This error occurred EVERY 60 seconds from 12:51:12 until 14:24:19.

When you deployed the fix changing dollar-sign-2 to dollar-sign-1, the query succeeded immediately on next run.


================================================================================
EVIDENCE
================================================================================

From event_log table:
- Event 322: "initial_alert_reminder_sent" at 12:50:12 (reminder_count: 3)
- Event 380: "ticket_auto_closed_no_response" at 14:24:19

Gap between these events: 94 minutes 7 seconds

From WhatsApp messages (user provided screenshot):
- REMINDER 1/3 at 14:46
- REMINDER 2/3 at 14:48
- REMINDER 3/3 at 14:50
- CRITICAL ALERT (auto-close message) at 16:24

Note: The 14:46 time in WhatsApp appears to be in different timezone or there's a display issue. The database shows 12:46, 12:48, 12:50 UTC.


================================================================================
CURRENT STATUS
================================================================================

BUG: Fixed (you deployed the parameter fix around 14:24)

IMPACT: Any ticket that reached 3 reminders between bug introduction and bug fix would have experienced this delay.

VERIFICATION: Since your fix at 14:24, the system has been running without database errors. The auto-close mechanism now works correctly.


================================================================================
REMAINING CONCERN
================================================================================

During the 94-minute period, the reminder checker was attempting to close the ticket every 60 seconds and failing each time. This generated database errors.

QUESTION FOR SENTINEL: 

Can you verify that the parameter mismatch bug is fully fixed in the current production code? Specifically check the auto-close logic in the checkPendingReminders function to ensure:

1. The query for closing tickets after 3 initial alert reminders uses correct parameter numbering
2. The query for closing tickets after 3 entrapment confirmation reminders uses correct parameter numbering
3. Both queries execute successfully without database errors

Also consider: Should we add error alerting if auto-close queries fail? The system silently retried for 94 minutes without alerting anyone that closure was failing.


================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

Add monitoring for auto-close failures so this type of silent failure is detected immediately rather than discovered 94 minutes later through user reports.

Example: If auto-close query fails, log to event_log with event_type "auto_close_failed" and consider sending an admin alert.
